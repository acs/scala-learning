/**
  * In this module I will play with Monads to understand them conceptually and practically
  *
  * Some definitions I have found:
  *
  * Monads are structures that represent sequential computations
  * A Monad is an object that wraps another object in Scala
  * (https://dzone.com/articles/simplifying-monads-in-scala)
  *
  * You can think of monads as wrappers. You just take an object and wrap it with a monad.
  * monads take a type parameter. We didnâ€™t just write M; we wrote M[A]
  * monads come with two operations:
  *   unit (also known as identity or return): performs the wrapping part
  *   flatMap (also known as bind):
  *               map with A => M[B]                  flatten
  *     M[A]  ------------------------->  M[M[B]]  -----------> M[B]
  * (https://medium.com/free-code-camp/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534)
  *
  * I do a lot of streaming data processing, with parallelism. Monoid, Applicative, and Monad are
  * very important concepts in my work
