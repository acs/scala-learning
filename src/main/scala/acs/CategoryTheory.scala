/**
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory
  * Category theory[1] formalizes mathematical structure and its concepts in terms of a labeled directed graph called
  * a category, whose nodes are called objects, and whose labelled directed edges are called arrows (or morphisms).
  * A category (monad?) has two basic properties:
  * the ability to compose the arrows associatively, and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.
  * Concepts: Monoid, functor, applicative, ...
